While Unity used to support Javascript (dubbed UnityScript), it was deprecated in favor of C#\r\n                    which lead to the decision to use C# as the game's language.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <h2 className=\"text-3xl font-bold md:mb-14\">\r\n            <span className=\"highlight\">Designing</span>\r\n          </h2>\r\n          <p>\r\n                    Before starting to code for the game, I need to design and set what the game is first.\r\n                    The game was planned to be a top-down shooting game with NPC Companions that can provide help to the player while fighting enemies.\r\n                    As the previous sentence entails, there are three type of units in the game, Player, NPC Companion, and Enemy.\r\n                    Using the OOP concept, all of the units are based on the class Unit.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h2 className=\"text-3xl\">Unit</h2>\r\n                    <p>Every unit are set to be able to:\r\n                        <ul>\r\n                            <li>Movement</li>\r\n                            As the game has top-down camera view, Unit needs to be able to move in the horizontal and vertical direction.\r\n                            <li>Attack</li>\r\n                            Every Unit need to be able to attack based on their attack point.\r\n                            <li>Health & Mana</li>\r\n                            Every unit must has a healthbar and a manabar to represent their current state. If the healthbar reached zero, they are either destroyed or in player character case,game over screen.\r\n                            <li>Field of View</li>\r\n                            Field of view are a certain radius that every unit have, whether player character or NPC. While these FOV are not seen on the game result, it is seen when debugging the game in the form of gizmo.\r\n                            These FOV are used to monitor whether if a unit is on a Battlestate or not. A battlestate happens when two unit's FOV with different tag(i.e. enemy and player) collided.  These FOV are the one\r\n                            responsible to simulate an encounter-like state.\r\n                        </ul>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        After having all of their basics, each unit type have their own specialization that differ from each other according to their role.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h2>Player</h2>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        <ul>\r\n                            <li>Movement</li>\r\n                            Player Character's Movement is decided by player, using the WASD keys to move around two axis.\r\n                            <li>Attack</li>\r\n                            Player Character's Attack is decided by player, where player can uses melee attack using F key and ranged attack that uses Mana by clicking RMB.\r\n                            <li>Health & Mana</li>\r\n                            Player's health will decrease if attacked by enemies, and when it reached zero will prompt the game over screen to appear.\r\n                            <li>Field of View</li>\r\n                            Player's field of view works as to monitor if they are currently on battle state.
