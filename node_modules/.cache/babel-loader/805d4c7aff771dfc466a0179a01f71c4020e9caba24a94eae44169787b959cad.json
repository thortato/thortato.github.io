We decided to use SimCity as example for higher levelled\r\n            building while slightly compensating the complexity for a more\r\n            casual low-poly style.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img src={ComparisonIllustration} alt=\"Comparison\" className=\"p-5\" />\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <h2 className=\"text-3xl font-bold md:mb-14\">\r\n            <span className=\"highlight\">Result</span>\r\n          </h2>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Over the course of three months, I created approximately 65 assets\r\n            for the game, each crafted with shading, texturing and lighting\r\n            effects. Additionally, I've also created six character portraits\r\n            intended for in-game uses.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            However, as the hype surrounding NFTs and crypto dwindled down, this\r\n            project was sadly suspended indefinitely. Nevertheless, as my first\r\n            project I am grateful for the experience gained and the opportunity\r\n            to enhance my 3D skills through my involvement in the Alterland\r\n            project.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <img src={MayorsIllustration} alt=\"Mayor\" className=\"p-5 mb-20\" />\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAO,gCAAgC;AACvC,OAAO,aAAa;AACpB,SAASA,IAAI,QAAQ,kBAAkB;AACvC,OAAOC,gBAAgB,MAAM,uCAAuC;AACpE,OAAOC,kBAAkB,MAAM,iDAAiD;AAChF,OAAOC,iBAAiB,MAAM,uDAAuD;AACrF,OAAOC,sBAAsB,MAAM,8DAA8D;AACjG,SAASC,UAAU,QAAQ,6BAA6B;AAAC,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAEzD,OAAO,SAASC,kBAAkBA,CAAA,EAAG;EACnC,oBACED,OAAA;IAAAE,QAAA,gBACEF,OAAA,CAACF,UAAU;MAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QAAE,eACbN,OAAA;MAAKO,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;MAAAL,QAAA,gBAEvBF,OAAA;QACEO,SAAS,EAAC,8BAA8B;QACxCC,GAAG,EAAEd,gBAAiB;QACtBe,GAAG,EAAC;MAAmB;QAAAN,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACvB,eAGFN,OAAA;QAAKO,SAAS,EAAC,0EAA0E;QAAAL,QAAA,gBACvFF,OAAA;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;QAAe;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAK,eACxBN,OAAA;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;QAAuC;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eAC9CN,OAAA;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;QAAwB;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAC3B;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QACF,eAENN,OAAA;MAAKO,SAAS,EAAC,+CAA+C;MAAAL,QAAA,gBAC5DF,OAAA;QAAAE,QAAA,eACEF,OAAA;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;QAOH;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA;MAAI;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACA,eAENN,OAAA;QAAAE,QAAA,gBACEF,OAAA;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;QAAO;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAK,eAChBN,OAAA;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;QAGH;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACJN,OAAA;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;QAA4C;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAC/C,eACNN,OAAA;QAAAE,QAAA,gBACEF,OAAA;UAAIO,SAAS,EAAC,6BAA6B;UAAAL,QAAA,eACzCF,OAAA;YAAMO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;UAAO;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA;QAAO;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QACvC,eACLN,OAAA;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;QAOH;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACJN,OAAA;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;QAKH;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACA,eACNN,OAAA;QAAAE,QAAA,gBACEF,OAAA;UAAIO,SAAS,EAAC,6BAA6B;UAAAL,QAAA,eACzCF,OAAA;YAAMO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;UAAS;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA;QAAO;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QACzC,eACLN,OAAA;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;QAMH;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACJN,OAAA;UAAKQ,GAAG,EAAEZ,iBAAkB;UAACa,GAAG,EAAC,OAAO;UAACF,SAAS,EAAC;QAAK;UAAAJ,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAG,eAC3DN,OAAA;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;QAKH;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACA,eACNN,OAAA;QAAAE,QAAA,gBACEF,OAAA;UAAIO,SAAS,EAAC,6BAA6B;UAAAL,QAAA,eACzCF,OAAA;YAAMO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;UAAO;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA;QAAO;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QACvC,eACLN,OAAA;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;QAMH;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACJN,OAAA;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;QAKH;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACJN,OAAA;UAAKQ,GAAG,EAAEX,sBAAuB;UAACY,GAAG,EAAC,YAAY;UAACF,SAAS,EAAC;QAAK;UAAAJ,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAG;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACjE,eACNN,OAAA;QAAAE,QAAA,gBACEF,OAAA;UAAIO,SAAS,EAAC,6BAA6B;UAAAL,QAAA,eACzCF,OAAA;YAAMO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;UAAM;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA;QAAO;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QACtC,eACLN,OAAA;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;QAKH;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACJN,OAAA;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;QAMH;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACJN,OAAA;UAAKQ,GAAG,EAAEb,kBAAmB;UAACc,GAAG,EAAC,OAAO;UAACF,SAAS,EAAC;QAAW;UAAAJ,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAG;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAC9D;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QACF;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,QACF;AAEV;AAACI,EAAA,GAvHeT,kBAAkB;AAAA,IAAAS,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
