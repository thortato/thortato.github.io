I then setup a local github for version control.\r\n            While Unity used to support Javascript (dubbed UnityScript), it was\r\n            deprecated in favor of C# which lead to the decision to use C# as\r\n            the game's language.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <h2 className=\"text-3xl font-bold md:mb-14\">\r\n            <span className=\"highlight\">Designing</span>\r\n          </h2>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Before starting to code for the game, I need to design and set what\r\n            the game is first. The game was planned to be a top-down shooting\r\n            game with NPC Companions that can provide help to the player while\r\n            fighting enemies. As the previous sentence entails, there are three\r\n            type of units in the game, Player, NPC Companion, and Enemy. Using\r\n            the OOP concept, all of the units are based on the class Unit.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h2 className=\"text-2xl font-bold\">Unit</h2>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Every unit are set to be able to:\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>Movement</li>\r\n              As the game has top-down camera view, Unit needs to be able to\r\n              move in the horizontal and vertical direction.\r\n              <li>Attack</li>\r\n              Every Unit need to be able to attack based on their attack point.\r\n              <li>Health & Mana</li>\r\n              Every unit must has a healthbar and a manabar to represent their\r\n              current state. If the healthbar reached zero, they are either\r\n              destroyed or in player character case,game over screen.\r\n              <li>Field of View</li>\r\n              Field of view are a certain radius that every unit have, whether\r\n              player character or NPC. While these FOV are not seen on the game\r\n              result, it is seen when debugging the game in the form of gizmo.\r\n              These FOV are used to monitor whether if a unit is on a\r\n              Battlestate or not. A battlestate happens when two unit's FOV with\r\n              different tag(i.e. enemy and player) collided. These FOV are the\r\n              one responsible to simulate an encounter-like state.\r\n            </ul>\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            After having all of their basics, each unit type have their own\r\n            specialization that differ from each other according to their role.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h2 className=\"text-2xl font-bold\">Player</h2>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>Movement</li>\r\n              Player Character's Movement is decided by player, using the WASD\r\n              keys to move around two axis.\r\n              <li>Attack</li>\r\n              Player Character's Attack is decided by player, where player can\r\n              uses melee attack using F key and ranged attack that uses Mana by\r\n              clicking RMB.\r\n              <li>Health & Mana</li>\r\n              Player's health will decrease if attacked by enemies, and when it\r\n              reached zero will prompt the game over screen to appear.\r\n              <li>Field of View</li>\r\n              Player's field of view works as to monitor if they are currently\r\n              on battle state. When on battle state, player's mana can't\r\n              regenerate.\r\n            </ul>\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h2 className=\"text-2xl font-bold\">NPC Companion</h2>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>Movement</li>\r\n              As NPC Companion is not controlled by player, they rely on\r\n              pathfinding to navigate environment.\r\n              <li>Attack</li>\r\n              NPC Companion is able to use a basic attack and a skill attack.\r\n              They can alternate between these two attack using fuzzy\r\n              logic-based AI.\r\n              <li>Health & Mana</li>\r\n              NPC Companion's health will decrease if attacked by enemies and\r\n              will be destroyed upon reaching zero. However moving to next stage\r\n              will cause NPC Companion to respawn back fully healed.\r\n              <li>Field of View</li>\r\n              NPC Companion's field of view works as way for the NPC Companion\r\n              to sense the environment and will make decision based on what is\r\n              on their field of view. NPC Companion will immediately become\r\n              hostile against enemy upon detecting them.\r\n            </ul>\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h2 className=\"text-2xl font-bold\">Enemy</h2>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>Movement</li>\r\n              Same as NPC Companion, they rely on pathfinding to navigate\r\n              environment. However, they are able to patrol if not on the FOV of\r\n              Player or NPC Companions.\r\n              <li>Attack</li>\r\n              Enemy is only able to use basic attack.\r\n              <li>Health & Mana</li>\r\n              Enemy is have health and will be destroyed upon having their\r\n              health reach zero.\r\n              <li>Field of View</li>\r\n              Enemy will immediately turn hostile upon detecting Player or NPC\r\n              Companion.\r\n            </ul>\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <h2 className=\"text-3xl font-bold md:mb-14\">\r\n            <span className=\"highlight\">Fuzzy Logic</span>\r\n          </h2>\r\n          <p>\r\n            As planned, I started to code after the design I set up before.\r\n            However while coding it, one the core elements for game, NPC\r\n            Companion need to be controlled by an AI as they are ran parallel\r\n            from player.
