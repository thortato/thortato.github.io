One of the more prolific game\r\n            at the time was Sandbox, with its voxel based art direction.\r\n            However, there are quite a lot of these voxel like aesthetics at the\r\n            time to which the studio decided to not use it as to distinct\r\n            Alterland from its competitors.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            We then decided to turn to Pinterest to look for further insight.\r\n            During the search we found that low-poly isometric style may just\r\n            works for Alterland. So the studio set the artstyle of Alterland to\r\n            be that of low-poly isometric style.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <h2 className=\"text-3xl font-bold md:mb-14\">\r\n            <span className=\"highlight\">Modelling</span>\r\n          </h2>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Alterland is a city building game where player can create and manage\r\n            their own land. There are 14 types of building that player can build\r\n            with each building type having their own benefit to help the player.\r\n            Most building type can be levelled up to improve its function and\r\n            changes its sprite, upward to level 4.\r\n          </p>\r\n          {/* <img src={LevelIllustration} alt=\"Level\" className=\"p-5\" /> */}\r\n          <p>\r\n            In Alterland, the 3D assets are not ported directly into the game\r\n            engine but the rendered 2D sprites was used instead. It resulted in\r\n            each asset needed to be rendered 4 times for each angle to\r\n            compensate for the isometric style used.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <h2 className=\"text-3xl font-bold md:mb-14\">\r\n            <span className=\"highlight\">Iterate</span>\r\n          </h2>\r\n          <p>\r\n            While the reference found in Pinterest was fine for the earlier\r\n            level building, things started to get complicated when designing the\r\n            higher levelled building. Higher levelled building were designed to\r\n            look more complex to make the player feel the progression they made\r\n            when upgrading buildings.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            These complexity of course, runs against the aforementioned low-poly\r\n            style. We decided to use SimCity as example for higher levelled\r\n            building while slightly compensating the complexity for a more\r\n            casual low-poly style.\r\n          </p>\r\n          {/* <img src={ComparisonIllustration} alt=\"Comparison\" className=\"p-5\" /> */}\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div>\r\n          <h2 className=\"text-3xl font-bold md:mb-14\">\r\n            <span className=\"highlight\">Result</span>\r\n          </h2>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Over the course of three months, I created approximately 65 assets\r\n            for the game, each crafted with shading, texturing and lighting\r\n            effects.
