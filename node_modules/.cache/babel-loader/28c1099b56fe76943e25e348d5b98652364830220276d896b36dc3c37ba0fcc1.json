Compared to a binary logic that reinforce on true or false, fuzzy logic ease it by having a spectrum between true or false (think 0.8 on a scale of 0 to 1).\"\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 123,\n            columnNumber: 25\n          }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"p\", {\n            children: \"With that in mind, we can design the parameter to which how the NPC Companion will react.\"\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 130,\n            columnNumber: 25\n          }, this)]\n        }, void 0, true, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 121,\n          columnNumber: 21\n        }, this)\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 120,\n        columnNumber: 17\n      }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n        className: \"section-column\",\n        children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n          className: \"text-container\",\n          children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h1\", {\n            children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"span\", {\n              className: \"underline\",\n              children: \"NPC Companion\"\n            }, void 0, false, {\n              fileName: _jsxFileName,\n              lineNumber: 137,\n              columnNumber: 29\n            }, this)\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 137,\n            columnNumber: 25\n          }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"p\", {\n            children: \"The core of this game, NPC Companion are designed to help the player while fighting enemies.

While Unity used to support Javascript (dubbed UnityScript), it was deprecated in favor of C#\r\n                        which lead to the decision to use C# as the game's language. \r\n                        </p>  \r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className='section-column'>\r\n                    <div className='text-container'>\r\n                        <h1><span className='underline'>Designing</span></h1>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                        Before starting to code for the game, I need to design and set what the game is first. \r\n                        The game was planned to be a top-down shooting game with NPC Companions that can provide help to the player while fighting enemies.\r\n                        As the previous sentence entails, there are three type of units in the game, Player, NPC Companion, and Enemy.\r\n                        Using the OOP concept, all of the units are based on the class Unit.\r\n                        </p>  \r\n                        <h2>Unit</h2>\r\n                        <p>Every unit are set to be able to:\r\n                            <ul>\r\n                                <li>Movement</li>\r\n                                As the game has top-down camera view, Unit needs to be able to move in the horizontal and vertical direction.\r\n                                <li>Attack</li>\r\n                                Every Unit need to be able to attack based on their attack point.\r\n                                <li>Health & Mana</li>\r\n                                Every unit must has a healthbar and a manabar to represent their current state. If the healthbar reached zero, they are either destroyed or in player character case,game over screen.\r\n                                <li>Field of View</li>\r\n                                Field of view are a certain radius that every unit have, whether player character or NPC. While these FOV are not seen on the game result, it is seen when debugging the game in the form of gizmo.\r\n                                These FOV are used to monitor whether if a unit is on a Battlestate or not. A battlestate happens when two unit's FOV with different tag(i.e. enemy and player) collided.  These FOV are the one\r\n                                responsible to simulate an encounter-like state.\r\n                            </ul>\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            After having all of their basics, each unit type have their own specialization that differ from each other according to their role.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <h2>Player</h2>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            <ul>\r\n                                <li>Movement</li>\r\n                                Player Character's Movement is decided by player, using the WASD keys to move around two axis.\r\n                                <li>Attack</li>\r\n                                Player Character's Attack is decided by player, where player can uses melee attack using F key and ranged attack that uses Mana by clicking RMB.\r\n                                <li>Health & Mana</li>\r\n                                Player's health will decrease if attacked by enemies, and when it reached zero will prompt the game over screen to appear. \r\n                                <li>Field of View</li>\r\n                                Player's field of view works as to monitor if they are currently on battle state.

However moving to next stage will cause \r\n                                NPC Companion to respawn back fully healed.\r\n                                <li>Field of View</li>\r\n                                NPC Companion's field of view works as way for the NPC Companion to sense the environment\r\n                                 and will make decision based on what is on their field of view. NPC Companion will immediately become hostile against enemy upon detecting them.\r\n                               \r\n                            </ul>\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <h2>Enemy</h2>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            <ul>\r\n                                <li>Movement</li>\r\n                                Same as NPC Companion, they rely on pathfinding to navigate environment.

Fuzzy logic works to ease down the condition for the NPC companion to act.\r\n                        Compared to a binary logic that reinforce on true or false, fuzzy logic ease it by having a spectrum between true or false \r\n                        (think 0.8 on a scale of 0 to 1). \r\n                        </p>  \r\n                        <p>\r\n                        With that in mind, we can design the parameter to which how the NPC Companion will react. \r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className='section-column'>\r\n                    <div className='text-container'>\r\n                        <h1><span className='underline'>NPC Companion</span></h1>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                        The core of this game, NPC Companion are designed to help the player while fighting enemies. In this game, \r\n                        Player are given three NPC Companions to help them, each with different role and skill. On the technical side,\r\n                        the NPC Companion are able to alternate between the state of basic attack, skill, and run. These decision are made\r\n                        using a ruleset that's ran through by the fuzzy logic, thus making it almost AI-like.\r\n                        </p>  \r\n                        <p>\r\n                            <ul>\r\n                                <li>Healer</li>\r\n                                The first NPC Companion that Player encountered, their basic attack is a ranged attack with\r\n                                the ability to heal player when the situation calls for it.\r\n                                <li>Warrior</li>\r\n                                The second NPC Companion player encountered. Their basic attack is a melee attack with \r\n                                the ability to Slash, dealing damage across multiple enemy in one instance of attack.\r\n                                <li>Mage</li>\r\n                                The final NPC Companion that player encounter. Their basic attack is a ranged attack \r\n                                with the ability to freeze, spawning a freeze field that harms and slows the enemy on top\r\n                                of it.\r\n                            </ul>\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className='section-column'>\r\n

development, both code and assets included, I am able to finish the game and \r\n                        propose it as my final year project which yielded me an A for the grade and allow me to graduate from my university.\r\n                        </p>  \r\n                        <p>You can try the game here:</p>\r\n
